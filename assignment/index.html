    <ol>
      <li>
        For Assign 3.2, #3C - I re-used the constant max because it was the appropriate number, however, I used it as the minimum value. Would it have been better to create a new variable?
      </li>
      <li>
        For Assign 3.3, #6 & 7, the console logs 'Removed -6 parts', which is a double negative. What is the easiest way to get a negative number to print as a positive?
